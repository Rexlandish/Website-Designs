                I work primarily in systems, gameplay programming, and maths. making extendable and easy-to-understand systems.
                With 6 (?) years of programming experience, I've worked on many projects ranging from small games and applets in python, to large scale games with complex systems in Unity, C# / .NET, and other software.
                Learning about programming design patterns is a huge area of interest to me; I strive to implement them where necessary to help keep code as extensible as possible. <br>
